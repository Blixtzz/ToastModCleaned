# ToastModCleaned
A better way to code, the original was poorly written, unoptomized and not really readable.
A base, a lot cleaner than my original code.


If you have game closing issues it's because your files arent places correctly, consult with me or read carefully
In the release tab of this repo theres a folder called ToastClient, place that in your vrchat directory (not mods, not melonloader) just vrchat and there should be no isses, inside there is an AvLog for anyone you show, an avtr_blacklist for the id's of those you dont want to see and that's all for now.
